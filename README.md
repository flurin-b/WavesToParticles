# Turning waves into particles
In the YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMP5Pbx8I4s, Huygens Optics describes how he used field simulations to create locally contained collections of energy.
To do so, he employed the python wave simulator https://github.com/0x23/WaveSimulator2D, which he modified to use a nonlinear stress function.

# Modifications 
We plan on making some modifications to the code, hoping it will allow the particles to persist for longer and ideally indefinitely.
These modifications will be summarized here as well as in the corresponding paper in the MathSem book found here: https://github.com/AndreasFMueller/SeminarFelder.
